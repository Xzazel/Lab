# Proposal
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Mario on Crack
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A basic level of Mario but anything can happen.
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
This is a video game level of Mario. And everything would play out like Mario but after the first unfair death you'd start to notice that the title screen changed and the music track also changed. The game gets darker and you have a new set of how many lives you have. Every thing is unfair you might die going down a pipe the floor might be missing anything can happen some deaths might even take more lives than others.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A working Mario game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Some unfair deaths like missing floor or spiked boxes

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything listed in my paragraph of details

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Get some artistic skills so I can change the background at will. Figuing a way to edit parts of the level so if the character gets too close to the trigger the reaction would accur. Also probably some music skills as well because I would need to change the soundtrack if I wanted to complete everything I want to complete.
